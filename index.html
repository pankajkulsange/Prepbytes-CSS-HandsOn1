      CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="unorderList colBrown">
        Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
      </li>
      <li class="unorderList colBrown">
        Internal - by using a style element in the head section
      </li>
      <li class="unorderList colBrown">
        External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li class="unorderList colBrown">
        The most common way to add CSS. is keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However,
        <span class="highLighted"
          >in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, </span
        >because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.

    <p class="colBrown">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript
    </p>
    <p class="colBrown">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of
      styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="colBrown">
      There is a wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied
